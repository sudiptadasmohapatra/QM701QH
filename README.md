Term 3 (May 14-August 12, 2019)


Course Overview
There is a huge influx of data that flows through the healthcare systems every minute. It is vitally important to draw meaningful insights from it and to understand and utilize the data to minimize the risks to patients and hospitals as well as to enhance healthcare outcomes. Specifically, this course is designed to provide students with advanced tools and methods to create value from quantitative and qualitative healthcare data. Students will learn how to analyze survival data to analyze time until an event (relapse, stroke, etc.), reading and evaluating textual data using natural language processing models (patient diagnosis and report), and analyzing images through Deep Learning tools. 

This course is intended towards quantitatively oriented students who will be exposed to core techniques using online and opensource analytics tools to meet healthcare objectives. We will emphasize many fundamental concepts and also review and work through modeling approaches using case studies primarily from the healthcare and medical domain. 

Basic statistical concepts are integrated throughout the course to cover both conceptual as well as applied nature of the advanced data science approaches. The course will be fairly hands-on in nature, and students will be expected to work with datasets, based on video lectures and class discussions. We will be programming in R using R packages to solve most of the advanced analytics topics utilized in this course. We also use Google’s TensorFlow package with Jupiter notebook to solve image analysis problems. You will get exposure to Spark in the computer vision and image analysis lecture and live session.

The course will cover the following topics broadly: 
•	Fundamental concepts of Survival Data Analysis 
•	Survival and hazard models and their applications in healthcare
•	Text mining and natural language processing
•	Sentiment Analysis
•	Computer Vision and Image Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks
•	Trends and opportunities in Healthcare using Deep Learning

Textbooks and Assignments

There is no specific text book that covers the topics included  in this course. The world of healthcare analytics is changing rapidly with new tools and techniques and thus, no existing text books can cover all of the materials taught in the class. Each week you will be assigned readings that will be sourced from leading industry publications and websites. The DataCamp tutorials and one Coursera tutorial (free to students with Duke Id) accompanying the lectures/topics are highly recommended. 

The main course materials will be available in the video slides, handouts, and readings, that will be posted. Additional resources asked by students will be posted on canvas. There is an optional reference book on survival Analysis that you may refer to for more information:

	Second Edition	Wiley-Interscience (2008)


Each group project is designed to make you think critically about the topics discussed in class videos and live sessions. Thus, each project will challenge you to reflect on a number of different topics and models discussed in the class. In addition, you will have to expand on the problems we solve together in the class, by combining them and critically applying them to a variety of different scenarios asked in the projects. Some open ended questions may have more than one right answer. 

The quizzes will be shorter, mostly multiple choice and will have fewer exercises and calculations. 
The video slides will cover all the topics that will be part of the projects and the quizzes. 

Computing and Software

We will use “R studio” as a tool to solve most problems and case studies in this course. For specific questions on R and R package, the instructor will provide information and resources. Please consult with the TA on coding and programming for the assignments and quizzes. 

Assignments and Quizzes

Details about the assignments, deliverables, quizzes and project will be forthcoming throughout the semester. However, the following provides a broad overview of what to expect: 

Team Projects (2): Survival Analysis, Text Analytics
Individual Quizzes (3): Course materials taught prior to the quiz day/time
Final Exam Individual: Short Answer type 

Course Grading

Letter grades will be assigned in accordance with Fuqua’s recommended grade distribution for elective courses. 
Team Assignments: 30%
Individual Assignments/Quizzes: 30%
Participation: 5%
Final Exam: 35%

Each assignment report should be appropriately formatted to receive all points. For the team assignments, the students are expected to work in their preassigned groups. 
 
Classroom Etiquette and Suggestions for Students

•	Large portions of the live sessions will be devoted to discussions and case studies as well examples. Participate actively in discussions during the class. Remember that “no question is stupid”.
•	We expect you to attend live sessions regularly and on-time. Prior to each live session, you are required to go through the class videos of the appropriate lecture. Fuqua norms should be adhered to always. In rare circumstances, if you are not able to attend (due to health reasons or other valid reason) please let the instructor know prior to the live classes.
•	Come prepared for the live sessions: this way the topic of the live sessions will not be completely novel to you and you will find it easier to follow the instruction during those sessions.
•	Seek feedback from the TA on your assignments 

Honor Code

The Fuqua School of Business Honor Code applies to all aspects of this course. The nature of each assignment indicates the type of communication and consultation that is permitted. Work that is described as an individual effort is to be your work alone, without consultation or assistance from any other person. Work that is described as a team effort is to be your team’s effort alone, again without consultation or assistance from anyone else. If you are uncertain about the nature of any assignment, please ask the instructor in advance. You are not supposed to search/download solutions from the web. 

Plagiarism and cheating is strictly forbidden. This includes both copying your classmate’s analysis or an idea of other writers without crediting source.
